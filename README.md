## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David. I like learning new things by starting with a silly idea and letting it grow. I just finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://github.com/recursecenter) and am looking forward to the next adventure!

### What's currently published online 

- [The WM7Â±2 Surprisal Calculator](https://surprisal.onrender.com/): A collaboration with [`eayhkim`](https://github.com/eayhkim) that converts the entropy of words in a sentence to musical melodies and vice versa
- [Faces & Feelings](https://wobblybits.github.io/expressions/): A static deployment of the `expressions` repository (work in progress)
- [Wobbly Bits](https://wobblybits.blog): Interactive experiments on a 1-bit canvas

### What I am currently working on

- [`/wobblybits/expressions`](https://github.com/wobblybits/expressions): Finishing up (ðŸ¤ž) the UI for configuring the pareidolia image transformation, improving the transformations themselves, adding an emotion detection component, and then having more fun with the social transference simulation
- [`/rafl/oeis-A007082`](https://github.com/rafl/oeis-A007082): A highly optimized counting algorithm to compute the number of Eulerian circuits on the complete graph
- A collaboration with [`fkettelhoit`](https://github.com/fkettelhoit) to conceptualize an extension of lambda calculus that allows for paradoxical logic

### What's on the drawing board

- Non-human vocal-tract synthesizers (and/or a talking ocean)
- Collaboration with [`sandpills`](https://github.com/sandpills) on the kiki-bouba effect
- Proximity-based telephony using LoRa and WebRTC 
- Learning the math behind representation theory
- More wobbly bits!
